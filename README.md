# Ho-Oh for Visual Studio Code

This is just a fork of [Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock) but the default colors are based on Pok√©mon titles.

I got the idea from this [message board](https://www.epidemicjohto.com/t882-type-colors-hex-colors) (2000s nostalgia...).

## Usage

If you were already using Peacock you can add the colors with by searching the command "Add the Recommended Favorites" in the command palette.

Usage and settings are the same as Peacock.
